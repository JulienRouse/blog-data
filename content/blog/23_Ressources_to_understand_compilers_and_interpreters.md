summary: 'Putting together some resources to learn more about compilers'
---

I have been more interested in how compilers, interpreters and programming language are designed lately so I am putting together a list of resources I am using or might use someday. Maybe you can find something interesting too.

This document is intended to be updated infrequently to add feedback about those resources.

One of the reason I am interested in knowing more about that subject (beside the fact that it looks fun) is that I want to learn more about Python in general, and the interpreters is a part of that. So the list might be skewed in that direction.

## Generic resources

- [/r/compilers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/) Subreddit about compilers
- [Crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) A book that is available online for free, with possibility to buy it on ebook or paper format. Looks really good to get a start and was recommended on /r/compilers.
- [thread about followup after reading "Crafting interpreters"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/comments/nc3kt4/followup_resources_to_crafting_interpreters/)
- [Awesome compiler](https://github.com/aalhour/awesome-compilers#courses) Awesome-style list for compilers. Probably contains more resources than I can consume in a few years. 

## Python

### Python used for implemention

- [(How to write a (Lisp) interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) Tutorial by Peter Norvig on writing a simple Lisp interpreter
- [(An ((even better) Lisp) interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy2.html) Followup tutorial on a Lisp interpreter by Peter Norvig
