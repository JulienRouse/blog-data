#	Final thougths on Svelte and the tutorial

## Opinion on Svelte

I had a lot of fun implementing my little prototype of an idle game with Svelte. I really like the editor in the browser, the quick install and quick deployment. 

## How to improve the prototype

Here is a list of features missing to have a game close to the original or to make it your own:

- implementing a prestige layer :) If you did not remember from the introduction or did not read it, you can go read about what is a prestige layer in the [introduction post]({{< relref "3_Introduction_to_Svelte.md" >}}).
- Working on the UI
- Creating new buildings: A building that gives a boost to all other building but makes the ticks go slower, a building that cost every resources available and gives a big boost in production for a period of time, or whatever you see fit :)
- Makes more detailed statistics about what was bought in previous play, how many times prestige was reached, how much currencies were produced
- Tied to the statistics is achievements! Often in idle game you can get achievement for every 100 buildings of a certain type bought for example, or for reaching 100000$ in less than 1min.

This is a short list, you can certainly come up with a lot more interesting twist on the game!
